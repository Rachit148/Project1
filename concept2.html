A transmission medium refers to the channel of transmission through which data
can be
transmitted from one node to another in the form of signal. A signal encodes the data in
a form suitable for transmission on the medium. A medium is characterized by its bandwidth defining the information carrying capacity of the medium. Common methods
of Internet access by users include dial-up with a computer modem via telephone circuits, broadband over coaxial cable, fiber optics or copper wires,Wi-Fi, satellite, and
cellular telephone technology (e.g. 3G, 4G).A transmission medium may belong to
one of the following two categories:
<ul>
<li><b>Guided Medium:</b>The term refers to physical conductors such as twisted pairs,
coaxial cable, and fiber optics. In twisted pair and coaxial cable, the signal travels
 as voltage and current signal whereas in optical fibre,the signal is in the form of light.</li>
<li><b>Unguided Medium:</b> The unguided medium uses electromagnetic waves that do
not require a physical conductor. Examples of unguided medium include microwave, radio wave,infrared.</li>
</ul>

<h3><li>Network Topologies</li></h3><br>
The arrangement (also called layout) of nodes in a network is called network topology.
There are broadly two types of topologies broadcast and point to point.
In broadcast topology, all nodes share the same physical link. When one node transmits, all nodes receive.Collision may occur when more than one node
simultaneously transmits, and there is a collision resolution mechanism for handling it.Broadcast topologies are mainly bus and ring. In point to pount topology,every pair of
nodes has a dedicated link.Popular point to point topologies are :-
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Bus Topology</b>:-In bus topology, there is a long cable, called backbone cable (or simply backbone), that
connects various nodes through a connector called tap .In this,a message sent by one is received by all devices connected to backbone cable. This
topology requires less cabling and is easy to install and extend the network laid using it.however,fault detection and isolation is difficult.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Ring Topology</b>:- In a ring topology,all the devices are attached through a cable in the form of ring.The message to be communicated is transmitted in one direction 
and isolation is easy. However, the topology suffers from the limitation of single point failure leading to disruption of the entire network sending a
message from one node to another node may take more time .</li>
<br>
<li><b>Star Topology</b>:-In star topology, all the devices are connected to the central controller called hub communication between any two 
devices takes place through the hub responsible for relaying messages.
Star network can be easily installed and configured also.Also, fault detection and isolation is easy. However, it requires more cabling
as compared to bus and ring topology.Also, hub failure will lead to network failure
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Mesh Topology</b>:- In mesh topology, every node is connected with every other node in the network as
shown in Figure 1.13 Because of dedicated point to point connection between every possible pair of nodes, 
the topology provides secure data transfer without any traffic
problem. it requires a large number of connections to establish the topology. This leads
to difficulty in installation as the number of nodes grow as the network grows.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Tree Topology</b>:-tree topology is a hybrid topology using a combination of star and bus topology. 
Backbone cable in a bus topology acts like the stem of the tree, and star
networks (and even individual nodes) are connected to the main backbone
cable like the branches of tree.
damage to a segment of a network laid using tree topology
will not affect other segments.installation and configuration is 
difficult as compared to other topologies. also, 
if the backbone cable is damaged, the entire network communication is disrupted

<h3><li>Network Devices</li></h3><br>
<ul>
Creation of a network requires various network devices,
each of which plays a specific role in the network.
<li><b>Repeater</b>:-With increase in distance, a signal may become weak and distorted. 
A repeater is used to restore the input signal to its original form, so that it can travel a larger distance.
Thus, it is placed between two cable segments It is also known
as digital regenerator which reshapes and amplifies the digital signal.
</li><br>
<li><b>Hub</b>:-Unlike a repeater which connects two cables, a hub connects several lines,
 also called,cable segments. A hub comprises several input/output (I/O) ports, each of which
connects to a single cable . Data arriving on an incoming line is
output to all lines except the line on which the hub receives the data.
</li><br>
<li><b>Bridge</b>:-A bridge is a multiport device used for connecting two or more local area networks
 (LAN), possibly operating at different speeds as shown in Figure 1.6 Thus, a bridge may
be used to produce bigger LAN by combining smaller LANs. A bridge enables devices
on one LAN segment to communicate with the devices on another LAN segment. Unlike
hubs, they are intelligent devices which exercise discretion while forwarding data to the
outgoing line leading to the destination.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Switch</b>:-Unlike bridges which connect two or more LAN
segments, switches are used to connect
individual nodes in the network with each other. Each node within network is connected
to a unique port in the switch.
On receiving the incoming dataframe, it forwards it to only a single line co
nnecting to the destination node. All the nodes connected through switch forms only one LAN.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Router</b>:-Routers are used for connecting various networks (LAN or WAN) with each other 
A router maintains a routing table of various networks. Based on the destination
address, the router determines to which network the incoming packet should be transmitted.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Gateway</b>:-Gateway connects networks based on different protocol technologies to communicate
with each other. Data coming from one network operating on one protocol is converted
according to the protocol of the outgoing network, and then
forwarded. Thus a gateway may be thought of as a router equipped with software for protocol conversion.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>RJ-45</B>:-
RJ-45,short form of Registered Jack-45, is an eigth wired connector that is used to connect computers on a local area network(LAN),
especially Ethernet.RJ-45 connectors look similar to the RJ-11 connector used for connecting telephone equipment,but they are somewhat wider.
</li><br>
<li><b>Wi-Fi Card</b>:Wi-Fi cards are small and portable cards that allow your desktop or laptop computer to
connect to the internet through a wireless network. Wi-Fi transmission is through the
use of radio waves. The antenna transmits the radio signals and these signals are
picked up by Wi-Fi receivers such as computers and cell phones equipped with Wi-Fi
cards. These devices have to be within the range of a Wi-Fi network to receive the
signals. The Wi-Fi card then reads the signals and produces a wireless internet
connection. Many newer computers, mobile devices etc. are equipped with wireless
networking capability and do not require a Wi-Fi card.
