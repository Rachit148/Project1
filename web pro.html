Web Architecture
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffe0">
<h1><center><u>Web Architecture</u></center></h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Web Architecture can be defined as the conceptual structure of the internet. The WWW
or internet is a constantly changing medium that enables communication between
different users and the technical interaction between different systems and
subsystems. The infrastructure of the internet is made of three core components of data
transmission protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS), representation formats (HTML, CSS,
XML), and addressing standards (URI, URL).
</p><br>
<b>Origin of web architecture</b><br>
The world wide web is a concept that was realized in the 1990s so that people and
machines could communicate with each other within a certain space. It is used to
exchange, distribute, and share information in a network. At that time, the web
consisted predominantly of static websites based on HTML, in other words, hypertexts
that can be retrieved by a browser. Dynamic websites and distributed web services
were added later.

<ol><h3>Types of web architectures</h3>
<table><tr>
<td>
<li><b>Client-server model</b>
<br>
Initially, the web consisted of a two-tiered architecture: clients and servers. Clients and
servers shared the tasks and services that the system was supposed to perform. For
example, the client may request a service from the server; the server answers the
request by providing the service. Retrieving a website using a URL address that directs
a server to load the site in the client’s browser is an example of the two-layer model,
also known as the client-server model.<BR>

The internet protocol family, which now consists of around 500 different network
protocols, is usually used as the basis for the WWW, but it usually comprises the
TCP/TCP/IP reference model. Three prerequisites must exist in the web architecture for
the application systems to communicate with one another:<br>
<ul>
<li> Representation formats with a fixed standard: The most frequently used formats
are HTML(HyperText Mark Up Language) , CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) or XML
(Extensible Mark up Language )when machines communicate with one another.</li>

<li> Protocols for data transfer: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is used in the web. Other applications, such
as mail servers, use SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) or POP (Post Office
Protocol).
</li>
<li>
 The standard for addressing: This refers to the URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
which is an instance of the more general concept of URI.
</li>
<br>
Finally, the web architecture is the operational structure of application systems for data
storage, data transmission, and presentation. When transferred to the web, the web
architecture typically consists of database servers that manage the data and resources.
They communicate with a client using a transfer protocol that can retrieve the data and
view it in a browser. The representation is usually done with HTML and CSS.

<tr>
<td>
<li><b> Three-tier model</b>
<br>
Three-tier models include an application logic between the client and the server, which
handles the data processing and allows a certain degree of interaction. For example, an
application server can process data while a database server is dedicated solely to data
storage. In this way, content can be dynamically loaded and saved. The script language
<p>JavaScript is often responsible for the behavior of the client.
Generally, a distinction is made between server-side and client-side data processing.
Dynamic websites are characterized by the fact that content is changed on the client
side. On the server side, modified content is stored via the application server on the
database server. Optionally, this can be a virtual server that emulates a physical one.
There are different programming languages and frameworks to implement three-tier
models like :-</p>
<ul>
<li> Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)</li>
<li> Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</li>
<li> JavaServer Pages (JSP)</li>
<li> Active Server Pages (ASP.NET)</li>
<li> Java applets, JavaScript and VBScript (client-side technologies)</li>
</ul></li>

<tr>

<li><b> Service-oriented architectures (SOA)</b>
<p>
Today the web is used for the networking of globally distributed IT structures. Modern IT
and web applications are much more complex than the client-server model. With SOAs,
business processes can be automated by the involved systems communicating with one
another - partly without human intervention - and performing certain tasks. Examples
include online banking, e-commerce, e-learning, online marketplaces, and business
intelligence applications. They are known as N-tier architectures and have so far been
used primarily in the business sector.</p>
<p>If the Web architecture was represented as an evolutionary timeline, IoT and Semantic
Web would be the top of the development. The architectures that are used there are
correspondingly complex.</p>
<p>The effects of different architectures are extremely diverse. From a user perspective,
websites and web services are changing to a degree that not even developers can keep
track of, what with hundreds of protocols, programming and scripting languages,
frameworks and interfaces. Websites become interactive, data can be exchanged
faster, and services interact with each other easily. From a developer’s perspective,
web architectures are becoming more and more complex and many different
approaches exist at the same time.</p>

<h2> Identification of computers and users over a network</h2>
<ul>
<table>

<tr>
<td>
<li><b> MAC Address</b><p>
Once a network has been set up, the nodes can communicate among themselves. But
for proper communication, the nodes should be uniquely identifiable. If a node X sends
some information for node Y on a network, then it is mandatory that nodes X and Y are
uniquely identifiable on the network. Let us see how this is achieved.Each NIC has a
universally unique address assigned to it by its manufacturer. This address is known as
the MAC (Media Access Control) address of the card. It means that a machine with an
NIC can be identified uniquely through its NIC's MAC address. The MAC address of an
NIC is permanent and does not change.</p>
MAC addresses are 12-digit hexadecimal (or 48 bit) numbers. By convention, MAC
addresses are usually written in one of the following two formats:
MM:MM:MM:SS:SS:SS
MM-MM-MM-SS-SS-SS
The first half (MM:MM:MM) of a MAC address contains the ID number of the adapter
manufacturer. The second half (SS:SS:SS) of a MAC address represents the serial
number assigned to the adapter (NIC) by its manufacturer.
For example, in the following MAC address,
00:A0:C9 : 14:C8:35
The prefix 00:A0:C9 indicates that the manufacturer is Intel Corporation. And the last
three numbers 14:C8:35 are given by the manufacturer (Intel in this example) to this
NIC.</li>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<li> <b>IP Address</b>
Every machine in a network has another unique identifying number, called its IP
Address. An IP address is a group of four bytes (or 32 bits) each of which can be a
number from 0 to 255. A typical IP address looks like this:
59.177.134.72
To make it easier for us to remember, IP addresses are normally expressed in decimal
format as a "dotted decimal number" like the one above.
On a network, the IP address of a machine, and not the MAC address of its NIC, is used
to identify it. Do you recall IP protocol? IP protocol identifies a machine with its IP
address to route the packets.
MAC address is used only when a specific machine is to be targeted. For example,
suppose we want to block a specific PC to access some network resource. If we use the
PCs IP address, then the PC is not blocked permanently as its IP address may change
when it connects to the network next time. Instead, if the PCs MAC address is used for
the purpose, then the job is done!
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique 4 digit hexadecimal number assigned to
each node on a network. IP address settings of a node can be changed by the user You
might wonder how an IP address differs from a MAC address. In fact, the IP address is
assigned by the network administrator or the internet service provider while the MAC
address is assigned by the manufacturer. Thus if a computer is transferred from one
network to another, its IP address gets changed whereas the MAC address remains the
same. From the IP address it is usually possible to track the tentative location of the
computer but this is not the case with a MAC address.

<tr>
<td>
<li><b> Domain Name</b>
So, whenever we have to communicate with a computer on the internet, we can do so
by using its IP address. But it is practically impossible for a person to remember the IP
addresses of all the computers one may have to communicate with. Therefore, a
system has been developed which assigns names to some computers (web servers)
and maintains a database of these names and corresponding IP addresses. These
names are called Domain Names. Examples of some domain names are cbse.nic.in,
sikkimipr.org, indianrailway.gov.in etc. Domain names are used in URLs to identify
particular Web servers. For example, in the URL http://www.cbse.nic.in/welcome.htm,
the domain name is www.cbse.nic.in.
A domain name usually has more than one parts: top level domain name or primary
domain name and sub-domain name(s). For example, in the domain name , in is the
primary domain name; nic is the sub-domain of in; cbse is the sub-domain of nic.There
are only a limited number of top level domains, and these are divided into two
categories: Generic Domain Names and Country-Specific Domain Names. For example
Generic Domain Names:<br>
·com - commercial business<br>
<br>·edu - Educational institutions
<br>·gov - Government agencies
<br>·mil - Military
<br>·net - Network organizations
<br>·org - Organizations (nonprofit)
<br><br><b>Country Specific Domain Names:</b><br>
<br>.in - India
<br>·au - Australia
<br>·ca - Canada
<br>.ch - China
<br>.nz - New Zealand
<br>.pk - Pakistan
<br>.jp - Japan
<br>.us - United States of America

<tr>
<td>

<li><b> Domain Name Resolution</b> is the process of getting the corresponding IP
address from domain name. It happens as follows:<br>
Suppose you mention a URL in the web-browser to visit a website. The browser first
checks your computer to find if the IP address of the server corresponding to the
Domain Name (embedded in the URL) is present. If this address is present then with
the help of this address, the corresponding server is contacted and then the website
opens in your browser. Otherwise the browser sends this domain name to some specific
servers (called domain name servers) to find the corresponding IP address. Once the IP
address is known, the server is contacted and then the website opens in your browser.
