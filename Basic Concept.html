<h2><li>Need for Networking</h2></li></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Resource Sharing</b>: Connecting computers through networking allows us to
share hardware and software resources. Examples of hardware resources
include peripherals (for example, printers and scanners), CPU, and memory.
Examples of software resources include system and application software, and
files that may include text, audio, and video content.</li>
<li><b>Communication</B>: Connecting computers through a network facilitates exchange
of information amongst the nodes in the network.Creation
of a network requires various network devices such as modems, routers,
switches, and bridges, each of which plays a specific role in the network.
Networks differ on the basis of transmission media used, arrangement of nodes
in the network, their geographical span, and their purpose.</li>
<li><b>Access to remote databases</b>: It is easy for an average person to access any
remote database, say for example airline reservations and thereby book tickets.
Likewise databases of trains, online universities, hotels etc can be accessed as
per the requirement. Remote-control/access programs can be used to
troubleshoot problems or show new users how to perform a task</li>

<li> Network Interface Cards (NIC) A connection medium, usually a wire or cable,
although wireless communication between networked computers and peripherals is also possible.</li>
<li> Network Operating system software, such as Microsoft Windows NT or 2000 Novell NetWare, Unix and Linux.</li>

<h2><li> Network Terminologies</li></h2></a>
<ul>
<li><b> Nodes (Workstations)</b> :-A computer becomes a node (also called a
workstation) as soon as it is attached to a network.
 Each user on a network works on a workstation. If there are no nodes there would be no network.</li>
<li><b>Server</b>:-A computer that facilitates sharing of data, software and hardware resources
s known as the server. A network can have more than one server also.</li>
<ul>
Servers can be of two types:-<br>
<li>Dedicated Server</li>
<li>Non-Dedicated Server</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Network Interface Unit (NIU)</b>:- A network interface unit is a device that is attached
to each of the workstations and the server which helps to establish communication
between the server and workstations.The NIC basically acts like an interpreter and is also
known as Terminal Access Point (TAP) or Network Interface card(NIC).The NIC
manufacturer assigns a unique physical address to each NIC card and this physical
address is known as the MAC address.</li>

<li>Switching Techniques</h2></li></a>
<ul>Switching techniques are used to efficiently transmit data across the network. The two
types of switching techniques employed nowadays to provide communication between
two computers on a network are: 
<li><b>Circuit Switching </b>is a technique in which a dedicated and complete physical
connection is established between two nodes and through this dedicated
communication channel, the nodes may communicate. The circuit guarantees the
full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for the duration of the
communication session. Even if no communication is taking place in a dedicated
circuit, that channel still remains unavailable to other users (idle channels). The
defining example of a circuit-switched network is the early analogue telephone
network. When a call is made from one telephone to another, switches within the
telephone exchange create a continuous wire circuit between the two
telephones, for as long as the call lasts.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Packet switching</b> is a switching technique in which packets (discrete blocks of
data of fixed size and of any content, type or structure) are routed between
nodes over data links shared with other traffic. The term "packets" refers to the
fact that the data stream from your computer is broken up into packets of about
200 bytes (on average), which are then sent out onto the network. Each packet
contains a "header" with information necessary for routing the packet from
source to destination. Each packet in a data stream is independent. The main
advantage of packet-switching is that the packets from many different sources
can share a line, allowing for very efficient use of the communication medium.
With current technology, packets are generally accepted onto the network on a
first-come, first-served basis. If the network becomes overloaded, packets are
delayed or discarded ("dropped").

<h2><li>Data communication terminologies</h2></li></a>
<ul>
Let us learn about some data communication terminologies being used.
<li><b>Channel</b>: A communication channel is a medium that is used in the transmission
of a message from one point to another. In simple terms we can say that it is a
pathway over which data is transferred between remote devices. It may refer to
the entire physical medium, such as a telephone line, optical fibre, coaxial cable
or twisted pair wire, or, it may refer to one of the several carrier frequencies
transmitted simultaneously within the line. Depending on their speed, we have
three broad categories of communication channels - narrow band which is slow
and used for telegraph lines and low speed terminals; voice band used for
ordinary telephone communication and broadband which is fastest and is used
for transmitting large volumes of data at high speeds.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Bandwidth</b>: In electronic communication, bandwidth refers to the range of
frequencies available for transmission of data. It is expressed as the difference in
Hertz(Hz) between the highest frequency and the lowest frequency. For example,
a typical voice signal has a bandwidth of approximately 3KHz. Wider the
bandwidth of a communication system, greater is the capacity and hence greater
is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a period of time.</li>
<br>
<li><b> The data transfer rate (DTR)</b> is the amount of data in digital form that is moved
from one place to another in a given time on a network. As studied before, the
greater the bandwidth of a given medium, the higher is the data transfer rate.
This can also be referred to as throughput, although data transfer rate applies
specifically to digital data streams. Data transfer rate is often measured in bits
per second (bps), although the unit baud , which is one bit per second is also
used. It is commonly used to measure how fast data is transferred from one
location to another. For example, your ISP may offer an Internet connection with
a maximum data transfer rate of 4Mbps.</li>

<h2><li>Network Types</h2></li></a>
<ul>
On the basis of geographical span, the network can be broadly categorized as PAN,
LAN, MAN, and WAN.
<li><b> Personal Area Network</b><br>
A personal area network (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among
computers and devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in
a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners,
and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The
reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.</li>
<li>
<b> Local Area Network</b><br>
Local Area networks (LAN) are private networks and can span a radius of up to 1 Km.
They are generally established within a building or campus.LANs operate at a speed in
the range 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps.</li>
<li><b> Metropolitan Area Network</b><br>
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) may be owned by a single organization or by many
individuals or organizations. These networks are used to establish links within a city,
and span an area of radius up to 50 Km. MANs facilitate sharing of resources by
connecting various local area networks For example, a cable television network within a
city.</li>
<li><b> Wide Area Network</b><br>
Wide Area Network (WAN) spans about 1000 Km. They are used for long distance
communication and are well suited for connecting remote areas. They establish links
within a country or continent. A WAN may be owned and managed by several
organizations. It connects various local and metropolitan area networks.</li>
